#  Netflix Dataset â€“ Data Cleaning Task

##  Task Overview
This project was completed as part of a Data Analyst Internship Task focused on **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**. The goal was to clean a real-world dataset using Excel and prepare it for analysis.

##  What I Did

- âœ… **Removed duplicates** (none were found in this dataset).
- âœ… **Handled missing values** in columns like `director`, `cast`, `country`, `date_added`, and `rating` by filling them with `"Unknown"`.
- âœ… **Standardized text values** (e.g., country names and rating labels) by converting them to lowercase and trimming spaces.
- âœ… **Formatted dates** in the `date_added` column to a consistent `DD-MM-YYYY` format.
- âœ… **Renamed columns** to follow a clean and consistent naming convention (lowercase with underscores).
- âœ… **Verified data types**, ensuring `release_year` is numeric and `date_added` is properly formatted as a date.

##  Files Included

- `netflix_titles_cleaned_with_summary.xlsx` â€“ Cleaned dataset with a summary sheet.
- `netflix_titles_original.xlsx` â€“ Original dataset before cleaning.
- `netflix_titles_differences.xlsx` â€“ A comparison of changes (original vs. cleaned).
- `netflix_cleaning_summary.pdf` â€“ A summary of all cleaning steps performed.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Python (for validation and automation)

## âœ… Outcome
The dataset is now clean, consistent, and ready for data analysis or visualization.
